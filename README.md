## Description
You have left from your own dimension for greener pastures. In The Winston Game, travel to multiple dimensions in a completely aimless quest. 
As time goes on, you might just make the right pathway through a world to help someone.

You are in a time loop until you figure out the correct route through each realm, and you unlock the ability to go to the final realm.

The files in this project include the Read Me file, the project proposal, and the main game file.

An area of improvement would be having more visual elements. I had some, but more would be better.
