## Description
You have left from your own dimension for greener pastures. In The Winston Game, travel to multiple dimensions in a completely aimless quest. 
As time goes on, you might just make the right pathway through a world to help someone.

The files in this project include the Read Me file, the project proposal, and the main game file.

An area of improvement would be having more visual elements. I had some, but more would be better.
